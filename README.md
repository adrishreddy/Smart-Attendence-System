# Smart-Attendence-System 

Overview
Smart Attendance system is a system that records attendance using facial features of students and also enables the respective faculty to manage the attendance and generate a report using a web application

Purpose
Recording attendance of students is very important for a college. This process increases regularity, punctuality, and consistency in students. On the other hand, it is important for faculty to keep tracking the attendance of students. The traditional way of taking attendance is odd fashion of talking attendance, in which faculty uses pen and paper to record attendance of students. This process is a completely manual process which may lead to inefficient attendance reports and it is a time taking process. In recent years, Fingerprint based attendance systems are used, which use fingerprints presented to record attendance. It also has issues related to scanners and also it is quite expensive and maintenance costs are high. So, to solve this problem, we developed this system called the Smart attendance system.

Motivation
Smart attendance system is very helpful for faculty to record the attendance of students. It helps in generating reports and sending messages to the students. It will save a lot of time and effort for the faculty. The reports which are being generated are efficient.
